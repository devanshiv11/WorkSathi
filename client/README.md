# WorkSathi 🛠️🇮🇳

> **Bridging the gap between daily wagers and employers through technology.**

## 📖 About The Project

**WorkSathi** is a digital platform designed to modernize the traditional "Labour Chowk" experience. In India, millions of daily wage workers gather at physical locations (chowks) every morning to find work. This process is often disorganized, uncertain, and lacks dignity.

Our platform aims to:
- **Digitize Identities:** Give every worker a verified digital profile.
- **Connect Instantly:** Allow employers to hire skilled workers (Plumbers, Carpenters, Painters, etc.) near them with one click.
- **Empower:** Provide consistent work opportunities and visibility to the unorganized workforce.
- **Language Support:** Fully bilingual (English & Hindi) to be accessible to all.
